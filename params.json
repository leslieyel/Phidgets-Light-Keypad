Different technologies exist and work in varied circumstances. For example: acoustics or vibration detection, computer vision, capacitive interactive foils, infrared and others. The existing technologies tend to not work reliably through double-glazing and in outdoors conditions. This project introduces an easy-to-implement, inexpensive solution, which is using light sensors to detect human actions and to interact with a computer. Light-Keypad can be used on any transparent medium, including through thick, coated double-glazing. This is a non-intrusive interactive method that may be used on existing objects and structures without modifying them. The prototype product has been used successfully in our current research project exploring the urban impact of digital screens.  \r\n\r\n\r\n![image](../gh-pages/ylimages/LightKeypad_2.jpg \"System Structure\")  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore information about Phidgets-Light-Keypad：  \r\nhttps://github.com/leslieyel/Phidgets-Light-Keypad/wiki  \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n==========\r\n### Software\r\nDownload and copy this project folder to anywhere you like in your local harddisk  \r\nExecute \"run.bat\" to start running  \r\n\r\n### Hardware\r\nFive phidgets light sensors (model 1143) are connected to a single Phidgets inter-face Kit 8/8/8, which connects to a Windows PC via USB  \r\nhttp://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=6&product_id=1143_0  \r\nhttp://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=0&product_id=1018_2\r\n\r\n\r\nRequires:\r\n==========\r\n### Pythion 2.7\r\nInstall Python 2.7 to C:\\\r\n\r\n### wxPython 2.9\r\nInstall wxPython 2.9 after Python 2.7 installed\r\n\r\n### PyWin32\r\nInstall PyWin32 after Python 2.7 installed\r\n\r\n### Phidgets Driver and Libraries\r\nPhidgets driver and libraries can be downloaded from:   \r\nhttp://www.phidgets.com/docs/Language_-_Python#Windows.282000.2FXP.2FVista.2F7.29\r\n\r\n\r\nProject information:\r\n==========\r\n### Funder\r\nThe project was funded by the RCUK Digital Economy Programme (EP/I031413/1 & EP/I031839/1)  \r\nProject web page: http://www.screensinthewild.org/  \r\n\r\n### Orgnization\r\nThe Mixed Reality Lab at the University of Nottingham  \r\nMRL web page: http://www.mrl.nott.ac.uk/  \r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\nLei Ye                  L.Ye@nottingham.ac.uk  \r\nHolger Schnädelbach     Holger.Schnadelbach@nottingham.ac.uk  \r\nSteve North             Steve.North@nottingham.ac.uk  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"Phidgets Light Keypad","note":"Don't delete this file!
